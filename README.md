## What Is a Self-Healing Mesh Network?

A **mesh network** is a web of devices where each node acts as a **sender, receiver, and router**.  
Unlike traditional networks with a central router, every node finds its own path through the network.

**Self-healing** means the network automatically reroutes traffic when a node or link fails — no manual fixes needed.

---

## Why It Matters

A self-healing mesh can operate **without Internet or cellular infrastructure**, which makes it ideal for off-grid and emergency scenarios.

### For Preppers
- Communication continues when public networks fail  
- Nodes auto-connect via Wi-Fi or radio links  
- Great for local coordination and situational awareness

### For LARPers & Reenactors
- Build in-game communication (chat, maps, sensors)  
- Fully independent of mobile networks  
- Every participant extends the mesh

### For Civil Defense & Emergency Services
- **Ad-hoc** communication when infrastructure is down  
- Link vehicles, checkpoints, drones, or command posts  
- Local, encrypted, and redundant

### For Military & Training
- **Decentralized** field comms  
- Redundant paths increase reliability  
- Less dependence on central relays or satellites

## Advantages & Limitations

| Advantage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Self-healing** | Traffic automatically routes around failures |
| **Decentralized** | No single point of failure |
| **Private & local** | Operates offline; Internet optional |
| **Flexible** | Works over Wi-Fi, radio, or Ethernet |
| **Scalable** | More nodes generally improve resilience |

**Limitations**
- Bandwidth decreases over many hops  
- Slightly higher power usage (continuous participation)  
- Harder to reason about without good visualization  
- Range depends on antennas, terrain, and placement

## Introducing OrbisMesh

**OrbisMesh** is a lightweight local **web UI** that turns raw mesh telemetry into a clear, interactive dashboard.  
It shows neighbors, link quality, and network health at a glance — and offers simple tools for configuration.

### Key Features
- **Live monitoring:** neighbors, signal strength, link status  
- **Configuration:** DHCP, bridge, and access point helpers  
- **Autostart & services:** persistent monitoring stack  
- **Local-only:** runs fully offline  
- **Modern design:** clean dark UI with green accents

## Installation

> **Requirements**
> - Debian-based OS (Debian, Ubuntu Server, Raspberry Pi OS, etc.)
> - An IEEE 802.11s (Mesh) capable WiFi adapter connected to `wlan1`

### Step 1 - Download the code
Download the Project as a Zip file. </br>
Do not unpack the Zip on your PC, this might change the file permissions!

### Step 2 - Upload
Upload the Zip-File to a destination of your choice on your device. A recommended location would be `/tmp`.

### Step 3 - Unpack
Navigate you your Zip-File location and unzip it
```
unzip <file_name>.zip
```
### Step 4 — Prepare a Fresh Node
Navigate to the **`/tmp`** folder.</br>
Run the instrallation script:

```
bash fresh_node.sh
```

This installs the core dependencies and prepares the environment  
(e.g., `batman-adv`, `dnsmasq`, `hostapd`, and related tools).

### Step 5 — Activate OrbisMesh
Enable and start the services:

```
bash service_activator.sh
```

This will:
- Install and enable the required systemd units  
- Start the mesh monitoring stack  
- Enable DHCP/bridge helpers  
- Launch the OrbisMesh Web UI

After a reboot (takes about 30-35sec), open:

```
http://<your-node-ip>:5000
```
for detailed configuration.

## Philosophy

Self-healing mesh is **digital resilience**.  
OrbisMesh makes that resilience **visible, controllable, and trustworthy** — off-grid, in the field, or in training.
